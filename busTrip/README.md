# 🕵️‍♂️ OSINT Challenge: Bus Trip

## 📂 CASE BRIEFING

**Scenario:** Our target, Person "A," traveled from Bhilwara to an iON Digital Zone in a neighboring city yesterday with his sister. To prove he made the trip, he shared this partially cropped bus ticket (`ticket.png`).

**Your Mission Objectives:**
Trace the target's exact trajectory to locate the specific iON Digital Zone they arrived at, then verify the physical intel of the surrounding area to answer the following:

**Question 1:** Intelligence suggests the storefront immediately to the left of the testing center previously belonged to a completely different business category. Is this true? (Y/N)

**Question 2:** Identify the business currently operating in that same storefront today. Based on the public regulatory information displayed on their signage, in what year was their current operating license issued? (20xx)

## 📷 INTERCEPTED EVIDENCE: The Mid-Journey Photo

**Scenario:** Along with the ticket, we intercepted a photograph (`clues/clue on road.jpeg`) snapped by our target from the bus window midway through their trip. On the surface, it’s just a passing view. But if you know how to look *beneath* the surface of a digital file, you might uncover the exact breadcrumbs needed to track their route to the final testing center.

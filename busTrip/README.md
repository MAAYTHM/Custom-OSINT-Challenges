📂 CASE BRIEFING: The Bus Ticket

Scenario: Our target, Person "A," traveled from Bhilwara to an iON Digital Zone in a neighboring city yesterday with his sister. To prove he made the trip, he shared this partially cropped bus ticket ("ticket.png").



Question 1: Person "A" claims they saw a food joint (which also delivers via Swiggy and Zomato) located immediately to the left of the testing center. However, from my previous reconnaissance of that area, I am highly confident that the adjacent storefront was occupied by a transport contractor, not a restaurant. Based on your geolocation and verification skills, who is telling the truth?



Question 2: What is the exact, current name of the establishment occupying that storefront today?

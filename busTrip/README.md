# 🕵️‍♂️ OSINT Challenge: Bus Trip

## 📂 CASE BRIEFING: The Bus Ticket

**Scenario:** Our target, Person "A," traveled from Bhilwara to an iON Digital Zone in a neighboring city yesterday with his sister. To prove he made the trip, he shared this partially cropped bus ticket (`ticket.png`).

**Question 1:** Person "A" claims they saw a food joint (which also delivers via Swiggy and Zomato) located immediately to the left of the testing center. However, from my previous reconnaissance of that area, I am highly confident that the adjacent storefront was occupied by a transport contractor, not a restaurant. Based on your geolocation and verification skills, who is telling the truth?

**Question 2:** What is the exact, current name of the establishment occupying that storefront today?

## 📷 INTERCEPTED EVIDENCE: The Mid-Journey Photo

**Scenario:** Along with the ticket, we intercepted a photograph (`clues/clue on road.jpeg`) snapped by our target from the bus window midway through their trip. On the surface, it’s just a passing view. But if you know how to look *beneath* the surface of a digital file, you might uncover the exact breadcrumbs needed to track their route to the final testing center.
